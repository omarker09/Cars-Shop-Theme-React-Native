Car Marketplace App
Welcome to the Car Marketplace App project! This Android application is designed to showcase the concept of a car marketplace where users can browse and view car listings. Please note that this is a demonstration project, and certain features may not be fully functional due to the absence of a real API and database.

Features
Browse Car Listings: Users can view a list of cars available for sale.
Car Details: Clicking on a car listing displays more details about the selected car.
Favorite Cars: Users can mark cars as favorites, but please note that this feature is for demonstration purposes only and does not persist data beyond the current session.
Random Data: The app displays random car names and prices because it does not connect to a real API or database.

Known Limitations
Favoriting: The "Save to Favorites" feature does not persist data because the app does not have a real API and database backend. It is for demonstration purposes only.
Random Data: The car names and prices displayed in the app are randomly generated for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, this data would come from a database or API.
Authentication: The app does not include user authentication and does not require user login. It is a simplified prototype.
